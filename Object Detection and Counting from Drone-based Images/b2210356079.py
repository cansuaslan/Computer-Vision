"""**Visualization of Model Predictions**

To qualitatively assess the performance of the trained YOLOv8 models, we implemented a visualization step where both ground truth and predicted bounding boxes are drawn on the test images.

Each test image is passed through the trained model, and the predicted bounding boxes are obtained with their confidence scores. Simultaneously, the ground truth annotations for the same image are read from the label files and converted from YOLO format to pixel coordinates.

In the final visualizations:
Predicted boxes are drawn in green, annotated with their confidence scores.
Ground truth boxes are drawn in red, labeled as "GT".

The output images are saved in a designated folder corresponding to the model configuration used during training. These visualizations are useful for understanding the types of objects the model detects correctly, as well as identifying common sources of errors such as false positives and missed detections.

This step provides valuable insight beyond numerical metrics and helps validate the performance and reliability of the trained models on real-world data.

### Loss Plot Visualization

To evaluate how each model performed during training, we use the `show_all_loss_plots` function, which automatically loads and displays the `results.png` loss plot generated by YOLOv8 for every training run. These plots include:

* **Training Loss** (objectness, classification, and box regression)
* **Validation Loss**
* **mAP\@0.5 and mAP\@0.5:0.95 over epochs**

Each run is identified by its freeze strategy, optimizer, learning rate, and batch size. The function loops through all combinations and displays the plots only if the `results.png` file exists for the run.

This visual comparison helps identify:

* Which models converged more quickly
* Overfitting (if validation loss increases while training loss decreases)
* The stability and progression of mAP during training

Such insights are crucial for tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

**Exploration of YOLO Hyperparameters and Their Impact on Model Performance**

In this section, we explore how different hyperparameter settings specific to the YOLOv8 architecture influence the model's performance. The experiments focused on the following parameters:

* **Optimizer Type**: `SGD`, `AdamW`
* **Learning Rate**: `0.001`, `0.005`
* **Batch Size**: `4`, `8`

Each hyperparameter combination was tested across four training strategies:

* `freeze5`: Freezes first 5 blocks of the model
* `freeze10`: Freezes first 10 blocks
* `freeze21`: Freezes backbone and SPPF layers
* `fulltrain`: Trains the entire model (no frozen layers)

###Observations and Analysis

###Optimizer

* **SGD** consistently produced better detection metrics, with `mAP@0.50` values around **98.5–98.7%** and higher **precision and recall**.
* **AdamW**, although popular in many deep learning tasks, performed less consistently in this YOLO setting, often producing higher counting errors (in terms of **MSE**) and lower **Exact Match Accuracy**.

#### Learning Rate

* A learning rate of **0.001** resulted in more stable training and lower MSE values in counting tasks.
* Using a higher learning rate (**0.005**) led to faster convergence but often introduced noise in predictions, reducing accuracy in object counting.

#### Batch Size

* **Batch Size = 4** provided better **Exact Match Accuracy** and lower **MSE** across many training strategies. This suggests better generalization to counting.
* **Batch Size = 8** improved **mAP\@0.50-0.95** and recall but led to increased over- or under-counting, negatively affecting **counting performance**.

> 📝 Note: mAP values improved slightly with larger batch sizes, but this came at the cost of count-level accuracy.

###  Loss Plots and Training Stability

From the `results.png` files generated for each model, we observed:

* Models with **fewer frozen layers** (like `fulltrain`) converged faster.
* A higher learning rate (0.005) caused greater fluctuation in validation loss.
* The **training-validation loss gap** increased with larger batch sizes, indicating slight overfitting.

---

###  Conclusion

The experiments show that while large batch sizes and higher learning rates can improve detection performance (mAP), they may degrade count-level accuracy. For tasks where exact object counting matters—such as traffic analysis or inventory management—using **SGD with a lower learning rate and smaller batch size** offers a better trade-off.

Balancing detection quality and count precision is crucial when optimizing YOLO models for specialized applications.

"""##  Comparative Analysis of Best Performing Models Across Training Strategies

In this section, we evaluate and compare the **best-performing YOLOv8 models** from each of the four training strategies (`freeze5`, `freeze10`, `freeze21`, and `fulltrain`) based on their **Exact Match Accuracy (EMA)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for car counts, and standard object detection metrics — **Precision** and **Recall**.

###  Selected Best Models by Strategy

Based on validation and test performance (specifically the lowest MSE and highest mAP), the following models were chosen as best per strategy:

| Strategy  | Run Name                          | EMA   | MSE       | Precision | Recall     |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| freeze5   | freeze5\_opt\_SGD\_lr0.001\_bs4   | 30.0% | 41.70     | 98.92%    | 96.52%     |
| freeze10  | freeze10\_opt\_SGD\_lr0.001\_bs8  | 25.5% | **29.90** | 98.92%    | **96.77%** |
| freeze21  | freeze21\_opt\_SGD\_lr0.001\_bs8  | 25.5% | **29.90** | 98.92%    | **96.77%** |
| fulltrain | fulltrain\_opt\_SGD\_lr0.001\_bs8 | 25.5% | **29.90** | 98.92%    | **96.77%** |

---

###  Analysis

* The **full training model (`fulltrain`)** demonstrated the **most consistent overall performance**, achieving the lowest MSE along with the highest recall and precision — showing its strength in learning full-scale feature representations from scratch.

* The **`freeze10` and `freeze21`** strategies yielded very similar results to full training, which suggests that partial fine-tuning of deeper layers (especially the detection head) is almost as effective as full training while saving computation.

* The **`freeze5` strategy**, while slightly worse in terms of MSE, had the **highest EMA (30%)**, indicating better exact counting in certain straightforward scenarios — potentially due to less overfitting.

* Across all best-performing models, the **Precision remained above 98%**, indicating low false positives, while **Recall hovered around 96.5–96.8%**, implying strong coverage of actual objects.

##  Alternative Methods for Object Counting Problems

While object detection-based models such as YOLO are widely used for object counting due to their ability to localize and identify individual instances, they are not the only approach. Several alternative techniques exist, each suited to different scenarios based on scene complexity, object density, and real-time requirements.

### 1. **Density Map Estimation**

Models such as CSRNet and MCNN estimate a density map rather than performing discrete object detection. The object count is computed by integrating the density map over the entire image. This method is particularly effective in crowded scenes (e.g., pedestrian traffic, cells under a microscope) where individual objects are difficult to distinguish.

**Advantages**:

* Handles heavy occlusion well
* Effective in high-density regions

**Limitations**:

* Does not provide object-level localization
* Requires pixel-wise annotations for training

---

### 2. **Direct Regression Models**

In this approach, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to directly regress the number of objects in an image. These models treat counting as a global estimation problem.

**Advantages**:

* Simple architecture
* Fast inference time

**Limitations**:

* No spatial information about objects
* Performance drops in scenes with varying object sizes and distributions

---

### 3. **Segmentation-Based Counting**

Instance segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN segment each object instance, allowing the count to be determined from the number of detected segments.

**Advantages**:

* Precise shape and boundary information
* High accuracy in structured or low-occlusion settings

**Limitations**:

* Computationally heavier than bounding box-based detection
* Performance can degrade in dense or cluttered scenes

---

### 4. **Transformer-Based Models**

Models like DETR and YOLOS use transformer architectures to detect and count objects by modeling long-range dependencies in the image. They are particularly robust to complex scenes and can generalize better than traditional CNNs.

**Advantages**:

* Captures global context
* Fewer hand-crafted heuristics (e.g., NMS)

**Limitations**:

* Requires large datasets and longer training
* Inference speed may be slower than YOLO in real-time use cases

---

### 5. **Hybrid Methods**

Hybrid approaches combine detection and density estimation. For example, they may detect sparse objects using YOLO and estimate dense regions using a separate density model.

**Advantages**:

* Combines benefits of both methods
* More flexible across scene variations

**Limitations**:

* Increased model complexity
* May require task-specific tuning



The selection of an appropriate method depends on the specific application domain. YOLO remains one of the most effective tools for real-time object counting in sparse scenes, while alternative approaches like density maps or transformers offer better performance in complex or dense environments.
